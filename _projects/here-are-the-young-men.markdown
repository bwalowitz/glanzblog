A coming-of-age drama set in 2003 over one last summer of adolescence. Directed by Eoin Macken, the feature is currently filming entirely in Dublin. The story centers around a teenage boy who is pulled into a world of nihilistic toxic masculinity by his charismatic friend. At the same time, he yearns after his childhood sweetheart, an independent girl on her own trajectory. The group of youths gets tangled in a summer of adventures, issues, and events that may change the course of their lives forever.
