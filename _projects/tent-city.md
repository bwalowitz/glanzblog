<p>A severe economic crash due to inadequate policies, partisan warfare, corporate overreach and automation has split the United States into the haves and have-nots. Large homeless camps are forming across the nation guarded by the Orwellian police state. When a child turns up dead in, TENT CITY, the largest homeless camp in the United States, the community’s local “Sherriff”, becomes the unlikely detective fighting to solve the crime.</p>
